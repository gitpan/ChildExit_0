Apache/ChildExit version 0.1
==============================

DESCRIPTION

Apache::Registry has a curious design feature that executes END blocks
repeatedly.  This feature was probably intended so that script writers 
can easily add clean-up routines.   However, this feature changes the 
intended behavior of most modules.

Apache::ChildExit allows scripters to postpone running END blocks until 
the ChildExit stage of an Apache process.

For more information, see the documentation in the file ChildExit.pm.
